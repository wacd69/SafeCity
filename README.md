Incident reporting system

The application allows reporting incidents within a locality. 

The user can create a new report by entering the area where the incident occurred and the type of incident (e.g., pothole, non-functional streetlight, fallen power lines, etc.).

The user can view a list of all reported incidents and filter the reports by area or incident type.

Example: "Vasile Alecsandri Street - Non-functional streetlight."
